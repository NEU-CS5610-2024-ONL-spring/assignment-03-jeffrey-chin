# LibraryApp

LibraryApp is a React web app that allows users to search for millions of books from around the world, and save them to their library. LibraryApp is integrated with the Open Library Search API to provide users with detailed book information that includes titles, authors, subjects, publishing information, and cover images. User libraries are stored in an external PostgreSQL database to allow users to save book titles and easily access them later. Other features of this web app include:

* Ability to give ratings
* Responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
* Secure authentication and registration using Auth0
* Simple and effective visual components built with React Bootstrap, including spinners, modals, and input validation tooltips

LibraryApp was designed with accessibility in mind, earning high Lighthouse ratings for all pages.
